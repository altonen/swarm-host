# `swarm-host` examples

This directory provides a collection of examples that show how to use `swarm-host` in protocol testing. The examples are centered around testing Substrate.

To run the examples, `PYTHONPATH` and `SWARM_HOST_EXECUTABLE` must be exported:

```sh
export SWARM_HOST_EXECUTABLE=<path to `swarm-host` executable> PYTHONPATH=<path to swarm-host/framework>

python covert-flash.py
```
